Various collaborative filtring algorithms evaluated using RMSE. The algorithms impleamented include:
1. User-User CF with Pearson correlation to calculate similarity.
2. User-User CF with Cosine similarity to calculate similarity.
3. User-User CF biased, taking into account the baseline when predicting ratings.
4. Item-Item Slope One algorithm.
